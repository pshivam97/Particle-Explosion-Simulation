# Particle Explosion Simulation

- Run the **"main.cpp"** file to view the PARTICLE EXPLOSION SIMULATION.
- The entire coding is done on **macOS on XCode 9.1**.
- This program is made using **SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library of C++**.
- Any *Betterment* of the simulation would be **highly appreciated**.
